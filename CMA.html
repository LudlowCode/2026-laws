    <title>Computer Misuse Act</title>

    <h1>Computer Misuse Act 1990</h1>
    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computer Misuse Act 1990</a> outlaws criminal activity using computers. There were loopholes regarding theft of data which allowed hackers who gained unauthorised acces to email accounts (famously including <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Philip</a>) and legislation was brought through parliament to ensure that this kind of activity would incur criminal charges and convictions in future.
    </p>
    <p>The <abbr title="Computer Misuse Act 1990">CMA</abbr> outlaws the following (in roughly  increasing seriousness):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unauthorised access to computer systems</li>
        <li>Unauthorised modification/theft/deletion of data</li>
        <li>Extortion/blackmail based on data witholding/encryption, such as ransomware attacks</li>
        <li>Creation and sharing of tools (programs/scripts) to achieve the above aims.</li>        
    </ul>
    <p>Maximum penalties range from £5000 fine/ 6 months' imprisonment to 10 years' imprisonment and unlimited fines.</p>
    <p>The effectiveness of the CMA has been criticised in recent times leadning to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-the-computer-misuse-act-1990/review-of-the-computer-misuse-act-1990-consultation-and-response-to-call-for-information-accessible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review</a> by the UK parliament in 2023, summarised thus:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Responses were received from 51 stakeholders and covered a range of proposals where respondents felt more could be done to protect the UK and take action against criminals.</p>
<p>These included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>New powers for law enforcement agencies to allow them to investigate CMA offences more effectively</li>
    <li>Ensure that the UK can take action against offences committed extra-territorially or that affect the UK when committed overseas</li>
    <li>Statutory defences to the CMA offences</li>
    <li>Ensuring that sentencing levels are appropriate</li>
    <li>Offence of possession of illegally obtained data</li>
    <li>Improved training for the judiciary and prosecutors</li>
    <li>Consideration of whether new technologies, such as AI and the internet of things, are adequately covered under the CMA</li>
    <li>Failure to prevent cybercrime / duty to protect</li>
    <li>Online harms, such as deep fake imagery</li>
</ul>
    Some of these proposals, such as online harms and the cyber duty to protect, are being considered under other programmes.</blockquote>
